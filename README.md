# Minesweeper â€“ Java Console Game (Built with BlueJ)

This project is a text-based version of the classic Minesweeper game, developed in Java using the BlueJ IDE. The game runs in the console and allows users to reveal cells while avoiding hidden mines.

## Aim
Reveal all the safe squares on the grid without triggering a mine. Numbers on revealed squares indicate the number of mines in adjacent cells.

## Programming Concepts Demonstrated
- Use of object-oriented programming (OOP)principles
- Clear application of conditional logic (`if`, `else`)
- Use of loops (`for`, `while`) for gameplay and board generation
- Manipulation of arrays and 2D arrays for grid structure
- Use of methods/functions to break down tasks logically
- Console input/output for user interaction

## How to Run
1. Open the project in BlueJ
2. Compile all classes.
3. Run the `main` method from the main class (e.g. `Minesweeper`).
4. Follow the prompts in the console to start playing.


##  Project Structure
- `.java` files for each class (e.g., `Minesweeper.java`, `Cell.java`, etc.)
- Designed in BlueJ with a focus on modular and readable code
